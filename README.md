## what it does 
- add and save book entries (title, author, genre, read status), stored in your browserâ€™s localStorage.
- filter books by their status(read/unread) or genre.
- stats for total books, read, unread, and total pages
- UI inspired by **undertale**, with pixel-cute text boxes and retro charm.
- minimalist and adorable!
